<h2>About go-owndoc</h2>

<div class="container">
    <p>
        <i>go-owndoc</i> is a project that aims to provide a clean, flexible, and customizable
        mechanism for generating and self-hosting documentation and API reference for Golang projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        It uses the same underlying mechanisms as the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code">godoc</a>
        command, but offers much greater ability to customize the output of the documentation.  The aim is to allow projects,
        especially private repositories, to generate and host their own high-quality updated code documentation.
